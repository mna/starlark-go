<!-- This is a template for Nenuphar change proposal process, adapted from Go's process. -->
<!-- The rationale to use a markdown file in the repository instead of an issue or some other external process is:
	* This is part of the repository, can be accessed offline from any clone, can easily move to another forge.
	* This can be reviewed as part of a PR/changeset using the same tools as for code review.
	* Easy to find back the discussion/review of any proposal, via the commit history.
	* Ideally, important discussion points should be included in the proposal and/or the git commit message.
	* Avoid using forge-specific tools for critical pieces of information, best if the repository is self-contained.
